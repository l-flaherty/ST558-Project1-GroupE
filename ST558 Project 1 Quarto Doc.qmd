## Data Processing

### First steps

1. Read in data, select only columns (Area_name, STCOU, any colum that ends in "D"), and rename column Area_name as area_name.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
EDU01A_data <- read_csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/EDU01a.csv") |> 
  select(Area_name, STCOU, ends_with("D")) |>
  rename("area_name" = "Area_name")
EDU01A_data
```

2. Convert the data into long format where each row has only one enrollment value for that area_name.

```{r}
EDU01A_data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = EDU010187D : EDU010196D,
               names_to = "Enrollment",
               values_to = "Value") |> 
  print(n = 20)
```
